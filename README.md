## Getting Started

Hey, This side Lakshmi Narayana K, currently pursuing 3rd Year at IIT Roorkee.
My System Configs:
OS : `Windows`

## Steps to run the code in your local environment

1) Create a sample folder on your desktop. (ex: `blockflow`).
2) Open the folder and right-click and select the `Open with [YOUR IDE NAME]` option in the `Show more options` to open the folder in your IDE. (ex: `Open with VSCode`).
3) Make sure you have pre-installed `git` and `node.js` in your local environment.
4) Open your IDE terminal. (In case of VSCode, press " Ctrl + ` " ).
5) Follow the below commands to run the code:
##
 -> 1) Clone my Github repository into your current sample folder (Make sure to follow the above steps).
   ` git clone https://github.com/KLNarayana03/BlockflowAssignIITR.git ./ `
##
 -> 2) Install all the necessary node modules to run the code.
   ` npm i ` or ` npm install `
##
